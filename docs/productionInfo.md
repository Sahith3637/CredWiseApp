# Production Readiness Checklist & Recommendations

This document summarizes the key areas to address for making the CredWise Customer Management System production-ready, based on a review of the current codebase and configuration.

---

## 1. Secrets & Configuration
- **Never store secrets or production connection strings in source code.**
- Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager for:
  - `Jwt:SecretKey`
  - Database connection strings
- Use `appsettings.Production.json` for production settings and exclude it from source control.

## 2. Error Handling
- Global exception handler middleware is present.
- **Ensure stack traces and exception details are never returned to the client in production.**
- Log errors to a secure, centralized logging system (not just console or DB).

## 3. Logging
- Audit logging and API logging filter are implemented.
- **Do not log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, PII).
- Use a robust logging provider (e.g., Serilog, Application Insights) in production.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT authentication and role-based authorization are implemented.
- **Add `[Authorize]` to all controllers and/or actions that should not be public.**
- Only allow `[AllowAnonymous]` for endpoints like login and registration.

## 5. CORS & HTTPS
- **Restrict CORS to trusted domains in production.**
- Enforce HTTPS redirection (already present).

## 6. Input Validation
- Validators are registered for DTOs.
- **Ensure all incoming data (including file uploads) is validated.**
- Validate file types and sizes for upload endpoints.

## 7. File Upload Security
- Restrict allowed file types (e.g., PDF, JPEG).
- Limit file size.
- Store files outside the web root and scan for malware if possible.

## 8. Sensitive Data Exposure
- DTOs are used, not entities.
- **Double-check that no sensitive fields (password hashes, internal IDs) are ever returned in API responses.**

## 9. Commented/Disabled Endpoints
- Commented endpoints are left as-is, per instruction.
- Periodically review commented code for security or relevance.

## 10. Dependency Management
- Regularly update NuGet packages and .NET runtime.
- Use `dotnet list package --vulnerable` to check for known vulnerabilities.

## 11. Monitoring & Alerts
- Set up application monitoring and alerting for errors, downtime, and suspicious activity.

|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Secrets             | ❌ Risk       | Use env vars/secrets manager for secrets            |
| Error Handling      | ⚠️ Good      | Never return stack traces to client                 |
| Logging             | ⚠️ Good      | Use robust provider, avoid logging sensitive data   |
| Auth/Authorization  | ⚠️ Partial   | Add `[Authorize]` to all sensitive endpoints        |
| CORS/HTTPS          | ❌ Risk       | Restrict CORS to trusted domains                    |
| Input Validation    | ✅ Good       | Ensure all DTOs and files are validated             |
| File Uploads        | ❌ Risk       | Restrict file types/sizes, scan files               |
| Sensitive Data      | ✅ Good       | Never return sensitive info in responses            |
| Dependencies        | ⚠️ Check     | Keep packages up to date                            |
| Monitoring          | ⚠️ Check     | Add monitoring and alerting                         |
